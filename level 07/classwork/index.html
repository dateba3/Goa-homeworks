<h1>HISTORY OF GEORGIA </h1>
<h2>History</h2
<pr>The nation of Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო sakartvelo) was first unified as a kingdom under the Bagrationi dynasty by the King Bagrat III of Georgia in the early 11th century, arising from several successor states of the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia. The Kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 11th and 12th centuries under rulers such as King David IV the Builder and Queen Tamar the Great. The kingdom fell to the Mongol invasion by 1243, and after a restoration under George V the Brilliant it fell again to the Timurid Empire in 1403. By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into several petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the Early Modern period struggled to maintain their autonomy against Ottoman and Iranian domination until Georgia was finally annexed by <br>the Russian Empire in the 19th century. After a brief period of independence as Democratic Republic of Georgia, the country soon ended up being a Soviet Republic until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991.</pr>

<h2>Antiquity</h2>
<pr>The classical period saw the rise of a number of Georgian states, including Colchis in western Georgia, where Greek mythology located the Golden Fleece sought <br>after by the Argonauts. Archaeological evidence points to a wealthy kingdom in Colchis as early as the 14th century BC[51] and an extensive trade network with Greek colonies on the eastern Black Sea shore (such as Dioscurias and Phasis),[52] though,<br> the entire region would be annexed first by Pontus and then by the Roman Republic in the first century BC.</pr>
